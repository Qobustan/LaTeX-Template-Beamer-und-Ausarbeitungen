## Common Patterns

All these branches share common characteristics:
1. **German Naming**: Branch names in German with descriptive purposes
2. **Milestone Markers**: Each represents a specific achievement or state
3. **Integration**: Their valuable changes have been integrated into main
4. **Historical Value**: They show the project's evolution but are no longer needed

## Deletion Recommendation

All branches in this document can be safely deleted because:
- Their unique contributions have been merged or superseded
- They represent outdated states of the project
- The main branch has evolved beyond these milestones
- Historical information is preserved in this archive
